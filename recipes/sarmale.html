    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is a very traditional Moldavian recipe. My mother and my
      grandmother used to cook it at almost every Moldavian holy day and
      sometimes on a casual day. I love it! If you cannot find parsley root, you
      may substitute parsnip or turnip.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¼ cups long grain rice, rinsed</li>
      <li>2 pounds pork loin roast, finely diced</li>
      <li>1 pound carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound onions, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon dried dill weed</li>
      <li>¼ cup sunflower seed oil</li>
      <li>6 ounces parsley roots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium head cabbage</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place rice in a medium bowl, and pour boiling water over it. Let soak
        for 15 minutes, then drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        the carrots, parsley roots, onions and tomato paste. Cook and stir until
        the vegetables are tender. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the
        rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 more tablespoons of oil in the same skillet over medium-high
        heat. Add the pork, and cook for about 2 minutes, just until browned on
        the outside. Transfer to the bowl with the rice and vegetables; season
        with dill and black pepper. Stir until everything is well blended. Set
        the mixture aside to cool.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove the leaves from the head of cabbage, and place them in
        a large pot with about 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil, and cook for
        5 to 10 minutes, until tender and flexible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cabbage leaves from the pot, but leave enough in the bottom
        to cover. On each of the remaining leaves, place about 2 tablespoons of
        the pork and rice mixture in the center, and wrap the leaf around to
        cover. Place the stuffed cabbage leaves into the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pot is full, place a few boiled cabbage leaves over the top.
        Pour boiling water into the pot to cover the cabbage rolls, and place
        over medium-low heat. Cover, and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the
        rice is tender.
      </li>
    </ol>
